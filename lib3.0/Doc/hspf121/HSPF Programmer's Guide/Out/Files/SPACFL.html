<b>Special Action Instruction File</b>

<p>Function

<p>This virtual file stores a set of special action instructions, which the Operating Modules will read and act upon.  Special action instructions are directions to interrupt the work of an Operating Module to make an ad hoc adjustment to the value of a state variable or parameter (e.g. to simulate application of fertilizer to the land surface)  

<p>Method of Operation 

<ol>
<li>It is written by the Run Interpreter, from information supplied in the UCI.<p>
        
<li>A copy of the next instruction for each operation is kept in its OSV.  As soon as an instruction is executed, the next one is read from SPACFL and stored in the OSV until it has been acted upon.<p>
        
<li>The Run Interpreter places the first instruction for each operation into its OSV.<p>
</ol>
    
<p>Structure 
<pre>
1 SPACFL 
 2 Exgroup data           Repeats for each EXGROUP in the run  
  3 Ingroup data          Repeats for each INGROUP in this EXGROUP 
   4 Operation_data       Repeats for each operation in this INGROUP 
    5 SINSTR         REC  A record. Repeats for each instruction for this  
                          operation  
     6 DATIM(5)      I4   date_time at which action is to be taken 
     6 TYPCOD        I4   Type code for variable to be acted on:   
                          2 for I4, 3 for R4, 4 for R8   
     6 ADDR          I4   Address of item in OSV which is to be altered.   
                          eg. If TYPCOD= 2 and ADDR= 31 we will alter the  
                          31st I*4 location in COMMON Block SCRTCH.  
                          If TYPCOD= 3 and ADDR= 100 we will alter the 100th 
                          R*4 location in the COMMON Block.  
     6 ACTCOD        I4   special action instruction code  
                           1 means reset value in location ADDR to RVAL  
                            (or IVAL)  
                           2 means increment value in location ADDR by 
                            RVAL (or IVAL) 
     6 RVAL          R4   quantitative data on the action to taken on  
                          this item (if it is REAL)  
      7 IVAL         I4   Quantitative data on action to be taken on this  
                          item (if it is INTEGER)  
     6 VNAM(2)       I4_C Name of variable to act on 
     6 VSUB(3)       I4   Subscripts of variable to act on
