HSPF currently uses timeseries multiplication factors that are not changeable during the time period of a run.  The factors are specified in the timeseries blocks (EXT SOURCES, NETWORK, EXT TARGET, SCHEMATIC, and MASS LINK) of the UCI file.  
<p>
The purpose of this HSPF enhancement is to allow updates to timeseries multiplication factors during the timespan of a run.  It is proposed that updates may come from an external program through HSPF subroutine EXT_UPDATE or through a special action specified in the UCI file.  This design contains details of 
<a href="Updating Multiplication Factors During Execution/Specification of Updates.html">specification of updates</a> by the user in either an update file or entry in the special actions block of the UCI, required 
<a href="Updating Multiplication Factors During Execution/HSPF Changes.html">HSPF code changes</a> and
<a href="Updating Multiplication Factors During Execution/Example.html">examples</a> showing details of how the changes will work.
<p>
It is estimated that these changes can be implemented, documented and tested with an effort by AQUA TERRA Consultants of x hours and a budget of $x.  A beta version updated HSPF could be completed in 2 months from authorization to proceed.  A production version could be completed 1 month after receipt of comments on the beta.  
<p>
Note that this effort does not include any changes to the driver program that will be needed to produce the multiplication factor change instructions described here.
