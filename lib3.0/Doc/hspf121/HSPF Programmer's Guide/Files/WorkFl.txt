<b>WORKING FILE</b>

<p>Function

<p>The virtual working file is used by the Run Interpreter to temporarily store information about time series linkages.  This virtual file uses the scratch pad locations used later by timeseries data.  

<p>The WORKFL is strictly temporary; the Run Interpreter uses it at the start  of the run, after which it is not used at all.  Subroutine group <a href="../CodeGroups/HSPFEC/TIMSER">TIMSER</a> in the Run Interpreter uses it to store two kinds of data:  
      
<ol>     
<li>Data on time series linkages. Each record contains information on a single linkage; the source, transformation information and the target.  These data are later used to assign values to time series flag_pointers for each operation in the run, and to generate primitive TSGET and TSPUT instructions.<p>  

<li>Subroutine <a href="../CodeGroups/HTSINSI/TSINS">TSINS</a> writes the primitive TSGET/TSPUT instructions to WORKFL, which are later used by subroutine 
<a href="../CodeGroups/HTSINSZ/TINSTR">TINSTR</a> to generate the final TSGET/TSPUT instructions.  
</ol>

<p>Method of Operation

<p>Subroutines <a href="../CodeGroups/HSPFEC/EXTTS">EXTTS</a> and 
<a href="../CodeGroups/HRINTS/OPNTS">OPNTS</a> read the time series linkage information supplied by the user in the EXT SOURCES, NETWORK and EXT TARGETS  blocks, and expand any entries which imply the transfer of more than one time series into several elemental transfer instructions.

<p>Subroutine <a href="../CodeGroups/HRINTS/PAIRS">PAIRS</a> writes these elemental instructions to WORKFL.  The entries are analyzed and sorted by subroutines 
<a href="../CodeGroups/HTSINSI/CHAIN">CHAIN</a>, 
<a href="../CodeGroups/HTSINSI/SAME">SAME</a>, 
<a href="../CodeGroups/HTSINSI/ALLOC">ALLOC</a>, 
<a href="../CodeGroups/HTSINSI/TARGET">TARGET</a>, 
<a href="../CodeGroups/HTSINSI/SOURCE">SOURCE</a> and 
<a href="../CodeGroups/HTSINSI/CHANGE">CHANGE</a>.  The latter four subroutines, together with 
<a href="../CodeGroups/HTSINSI/TSINS">TSINS</a>, finally use all this information to generate the  primitive TSGET/TSPUT  instructions and add them to the existing entries in WORKFL.  The primitive instructions are expanded in subroutine group 
<a href="../CodeGroups/HTSINSZ/TINSTR">TINSTR</a> to full TSGET/TSPUT instructions, which are finally written to 
<a href="TSGETFL">TSGETF</a> and 
<a href="TSPUTFL">TSPUTF</a>. 
          
<p>The above procedure is applied separately to each EXGROUP in the run. The file is reused for each EXGROUP.  Entries for each group  start at record 1.  This saves file space and can be done because no entry in the NETWORK Block may link time series belonging  to  operations in different EXGROUPS.
