 The continuity error reported below is greater than 1 part in 1000 and is
 therefore considered high.

 Did you specify any "special actions"?  If so, they could account for it.

 Relevant data are:
&D

 &CCCCC :&I

     RELERR       STORS        STOR       MATIN      MATDIF
 &R          &R          &R          &R          &R

 Where:

 RELERR is the relative error (ERROR/REFVAL).
 ERROR  is (STOR-STORS) - MATDIF.
 REFVAL is the reference value (STORS+MATIN).
 STOR   is the storage of material in the processing unit (land-segment or
           reach/reservior) at the end of the present interval.
 STORS  is the storage of material in the pu at the start of the present
           printout reporting period.
 MATIN  is the total inflow of material to the pu during the present printout
           reporting period.
 MATDIF is the net inflow (inflow-outflow) of material to the pu during the
           present printout reporting period.
