 The end of the multiple timeseries sequential input file was reached before
 any data was found.  Is the name correct in the FILES block?  Are MUTFL and
 NLINES correct in Table-type MUTSINFO?

 PLTGEN: &I   

 The PLOTINFO table for this PLTGEN specifies that &I    point-valued timeseries
 should be supplied.  However, POINT &I    was not supplied in the EXT SOURCES,
 NETWORK, or SCHEMATIC blocks.  Is the source time series specified in one of
 these blocks?  Has it been commented out?

 If the intended source of this time series is an operation - is that operation
 commented out in the OPN SEQUENCE block?

 If the intended source is a PERLND, IMPLND, or RCHRES - is the appropriate
 module section turned on in the ACTIVITY table?
