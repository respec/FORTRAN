 A negative value is projected for organic phosphorus.  To avoid the problem,
 fluxes will arbitrarily be reduced.  Relevant data are:

 Where:
 FRAC is the factor by which fluxes will be reduced, to avoid the negative
      concentration.
 ORGP is the mass of organic P before reaction (LB/ACRE or KG/HA)
 TORGP is the projected (negative) mass of organic P after reaction
      (LB/ACRE or KG/HA)
 MINZOP is the projected mineralization of organic P (LB/ACRE or KG/HA)
      per interval
 IMMP4 is the projected immobilization of phosphate (LB/ACRE or KG/HA)
      per interval
