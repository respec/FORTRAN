 Subroutine Colby is set up to simulate sand transport only when the
 following conditions are met:

  0.1<db50<0.8mm; 0.1<hydraulic radius<100ft; 1<velocity<10ft/sec.

 At least one of the values printed below is outside of this range.

 HSPF will automatically switch to the Toffaleti method for this time step.

 When sediment is being simulated, all 3 "auxiliary flags" (AUX1FG, etc)
 in section HYDR must be turned on to compute shear velocity, etc.
 This was not done.

 When specifying the initial composition of the bed, the fraction of
 sand, silt, and clay must sum to a value close to 1.0.  This
 condition was not met.  The values supplied were:
       Sand       Silt       Clay
