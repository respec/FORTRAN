 PERLND operation &I    has no active sections.

 The printout level (PFLAG) for one or more sections of PERLND
 operation &I    is 2; that is, some printout should occur more
 frequently than daily.  In this case, the value of pivl (specified
 by the user or by default) must imply a minimum printout interval
 of one day or an integer fraction thereof.  However, this condition
 has been violated since the value of pdelt is &I    minutes.
 The remedy is to adjust pivl so that pdelt (delt*pivl) meets the
 above requirement.

 The binary out level (BFLAG) for one or more sections of PERLND
 operation &I    is 2; that is, some output should occur more
 frequently than daily.  In this case, the value of bivl (specified
 by the user or by default) must imply a minimum output interval
 of one day or an integer fraction thereof.  However, this condition
 has been violated since the value of bdelt is &I    minutes.
 The remedy is to adjust bivl so that bdelt (delt*bivl) meets the
 above requirement.

The binary output interval (BIVL) for one or more PERLND operations
does not equal the print output interval (PIVL), and both the
binary and print output options are on.  When using both binary
and print output options, BIVL must equal PIVL.  The remedy is to
change one or the other.  BIVL = &I   ,  and PIVL = &I   .
