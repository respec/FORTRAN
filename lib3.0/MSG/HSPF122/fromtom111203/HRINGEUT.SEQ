#GROUP    1  TYPE TEXT
$TEXT

The heading '&CCCCCCCCCCC' has been found, but the delimiter
'&CCCCCCCCCCC' was expected.
$HELP
Subroutine LOCBLK searches for self-contained "blocks" of text,
i.e. a group of lines commencing with a valid heading <HEADING>
and ending with a corresponding delimiter END <HEADING>.  Once a
valid heading has been found, the code expects to find the corresponding
delimiter before another heading is found.
#GROUP    2  TYPE TEXT
$TEXT
   20    1    1    5
The heading '&CCCCCCCCCCC' has occurred too many times.  The maximum
number of times this heading can occur is &I  .
$HELP
Subroutine LOCBLK expects the no. of occurrences of each heading (and its
corresponding delimiter) not to exceed the "dimension" specified for it.
#GROUP    3  TYPE TEXT
$TEXT
   20    1    1    5
The first non-comment line in a run data set, or after a delimiter
(eg. END <HEADING>), must be a valid heading.  Instead, '&CCCCCCCCCCC'
was found.  Possibly it was not recognized because of mis-spelling or
incorrect column position.
#GROUP    4  TYPE TEXT
$TEXT
   20    1    1    5
The delimiter '&CCCCCCCCCCC' has been found but is not valid.
(Has it been misspelled or placed in the wrong columns?)
$HELP
A delimiter has the form END <HEADING> where <HEADING> must be a
valid heading.
#GROUP    5  TYPE TEXT
$TEXT
   20    1    1    5
The delimiter '&CCCCCCCCCCC' was found but not expected because an open
heading did not precede it.
$HELP
A heading is considered "open" when it is found, and "closed" when
the corresponding delimiter is found.  A delimiter is only expected
if one heading is open.
#GROUP    6  TYPE TEXT
$TEXT
   20    1    1    5
The delimiter '&CCCCCCCCCCC' was found but does not match the currently
open heading '&CCCCCCCCCCC'.  (Is it mis-spelled or placed in the wrong
columns?)
#GROUP    7  TYPE TEXT
$TEXT
   20    1    1    5
The end of the range of text was reached before a delimiter for the
heading '&CCCCCCCCCCC' was found.  (Was the delimiter mis-spelled or
placed in the wrong columns?)
$HELP
Subroutine LOCBLK does not expect the range of text which it is searching
to end with a partial block of text (ie. without an END <HEADING>).
#GROUP    8  TYPE TEXT
$TEXT
   20    1    1    5
A value of &I    was found for the value of TOPFST.  The TOPFST field
in the ext sources, network or spec-actions blocks must contain a
positive value.
#GROUP    9  TYPE TEXT
$TEXT
   20    1    1    5
A value of &I    was found for the value of TOPLST.  The TOPLST field in
the ext sources, network or spec-actions blocks may not contain a value
smaller than    &I, the value of TOPFST (except zero).
