Here is a rounded off summary of monthly denitrification totals before and
after the threshold parameters was put in place:

Also, for your review, here is the section of code around the call to NITRXN
where soil mass and the threshold-adjust denitrification rate are calculated:

C     transport nitrogen species
      CALL NITMOV (LPRZOT,MODID)
C
      DO 150 I = 1,NCOM2
C       perform nitrogen reactions per compartment
        WRITE(LAYID,2000) I
C       convert from cm to kg/ha
        SLMOIS = SW(I) * 1.0E5
C       convert from g/cm3 to kg/ha
        SLMASS = BD(I) * DELX(I) * 1.0E5
C       convert from cm to inches
        SLWILT = WP(I) / 2.54
        WS     = SW(I) / 2.54
C       create temporary value for denitrification rate based on threshold
        TMPKDN = NPM(5,I)
        IF (THETN(I).GT.DNTHRS(I)) THEN
C         determine rate for denitrification based on water content
          NPM(5,I) = (THETN(I)-DNTHRS(I))/
     $               (THETAS(I)-DNTHRS(I)) * NPM (5,I)
        ELSE
C         water content below threshold for denitrification
          NPM(5,I) = 0.0
        END IF
        CALL NITRXN(IPRZM,I1,DATIM,LPRZOT,ITMAXA,GNPM,I1,
     I              I1,FORAFG,SPT(I),SLMOIS,SLMASS,NPM(1,I),LAYID,
     I              KPLN(I),NUPTFG,FIXNFG,ALPNFG,AMVOFG,NUPTG(I),NMXRAT,
     I              SLWILT,ORNPM(1,I),KVOL(I),THVOL,TRFVOL,DUM,DUM,
     I              KRETBN(I),BGNPRF,ANUTF(I),WS,
     M              NDFC(I),NWCNT,NECNT,AGPLTN,NIT(1,I),NRXF(1,I))
C       restore input value for denitrification rate
        NPM(5,I) = TMPKDN
 150  CONTINUE


where:
      SLMASS = soil mass (Kg/Ha)
      DNTHRS = denitrification threshold value (converted from input percentage
               of saturation water content to an actual water content value)


Finally, I have not yet aligned the flux totals under their columns as you
suggested Tony, but I have got the annual fluxes being reported correctly.
