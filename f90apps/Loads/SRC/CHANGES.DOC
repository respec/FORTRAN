Changes to Estimator Code in August 1997:

Adding Estimator to GenScn as an Analysis Tool


code group      explanation of change
----------      ---------------------

main.for        all screen interaction moved to this new code group.
                not used in gui version of estimator.

boxpit94.for    no changes

estimato.for    formerly contained main program, now a subroutine
                called from GenScn.  interaction removed and new
                arguments added to pass information from user and
                return error codes.

getdatc2.for    interaction removed and new arguments added to pass
                information from user and return error codes.

getdate.for     interaction removed and new arguments added to pass
                information from user and return error codes.

graphres.for    added character variables to send labels to graphics
                routines.  required by hass coding conventions.

logload.for     added error codes in place of stop statements.

readd.for       interaction removed and new arguments added to pass
                information from user and return error codes.  also
                added subroutine gpcode to return valid parameter values,
                which is necessary in the gui version.

regress.for     removed two unused variables.

rsquare.for     no changes

tacit013.for    corrected dimensioning of variables in three places
                which were producing array bounds problems on the pc.
                also explicitly declared several variables.

utility.for     no changes


These changes result in only one minor change to the look and feel of
running the batch estimator program.  The parameter file name is now
explicitly entered by the user due to the characteristic of the dos
operating system which prohibits more than one extension to a file name
(for example, the name 'test.qw.cmnd' works in unix but not dos).
