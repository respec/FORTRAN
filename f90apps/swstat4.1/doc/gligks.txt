This program uses the GLIGKS graphics library, V4.5.24, to generate 
graphics.  You do not need to install the GLIGKS graphics library on
your computer to use this pre-compiled distribution.  You do need the
GLIGKS file gksfont.dat; the bin_data subdirectory of this distribution
contains a copy of the file.  The program expects to find the file in
the /usr/local/lib directory, but, you can install it elsewhere.  If
you do not already have gksfont.dat installed:

  o  For the standard installation, copy the file to /usr/local/lib,
     from the bin_data directory of this distribtution:

     cp -p gksfont.dat /usr/local/lib

     (note that you may need system administrator rights)


  o  If you install the file elsewhere, you will need to tell GLIGKS
     about the new font path:

         setenv GLI_HOME path
     or  export GLI_HOME=path

     (Note that each user of the software will need to set the path
     for GLI_HOME.)
