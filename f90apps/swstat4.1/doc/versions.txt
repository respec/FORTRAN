variable   current value         description
--------   --------------------  -----------------------------------------------
WrdA       /usr/opt/wrdapp       Path name of directory containing the
                                 program, related programs, and required
                                 libraries.  The libanne libraries (version
                                 4.0, or later) are expected to be in this
                                 directory.
Libr       $(WrdA)/libanne4.0    Path name to libanne library, must be version
                                 4.0, or later.
FFLAGS     $(OptM) $(FFVrsn)     Fortran compiler flags
FC         f77                   Fortran compiler name
FFVrsn     $(FFUnix)             Target operating system.  Specifies any
                                 platform and (or) compiler specific
                                 compile options; assumes generic Unix.
                                 FFAIX provided.  Use FFSun, FFDG, FFDec,
                                 FFLinux, or FFHP to add specific options.
LdA        $(LdSunA) --+   +---  Platform specific load options.  Ld___A,
                       |   |     Ld___B, Ld___C and LGks are combined.  Use
LdB        $(LdSunB)   +---+     the Unix versions for system defaults.  The
                       |   |     Sun versions are used to create a static
LdC        $(LdSunC) --+   |     executable on the Sun so that the user does
                           |     not need to have Fortran installed on their
                           |     computer if all they want to do is run the
                           +---  program.
LGks       $(GliGks_S)           GKS graphics library, options provided for:
                                     GLIGKS (Static and Dynamic)
                                     XGKS (Static and Dynamic)
                                 Depending on how the graphics library has been
                                 installed on your system, you may need to
                                 adjust the load options or define your own.
Strip      $(Strip_Y)            Option to strip out unneeded symbol table,
                                 string table, and line number information
                                 from the executable; options provided for:
                                   Strip_Y = strip     (yes, strip it out)
                                   Strip_N = [blank]   (no, keep it in)
                                 Do not strip if you want debug information.
SHELL      /bin/sh               The make file contains commands for the
                                 Bourne shell, sh.  This will override
                                 implementations of make that use the
                                 SHELL environment variable.  If this is
                                 changed, additional changes will probably
                                 have to be made in the make file.
shCmd      sh                    The shell command is sh.  If SHELL is
                                 changed, this may need to be modified.

FNAME      /usr/opt/wrdapp       Full path name of the required message
               /swstat4.1/...    file.  If you install the program in a
                                 directory other than /usr/opt/wrdapp,
                                 you will have to change this.  This is
                                 usually the last line in the file.

Stat       $WrdA/swstat4.1       Path name to swstat program
Iowd       $WrdA/iowdm4.1        Path name to iowdm program (must be
                                 version 4.0 or later)
Anne       $WrdA/annie4.0        Path name to annie program (must be
                                 version 4.0 or later)
Gks        $GliGks               Graphics library being used, options
                                 provided for:
                                    GliGks = [blank]  (include ps output)
                                      Xgks = x        (no ps output)
                                  PriorGks = [blank]  (include ps output)
                                 If Gks is defined to 'x', only screen
                                 graphs will be generated.  If Gks is
                                 defined to ' ', PostScript and (or) Cgm
                                 files will also be generated.
