*       <<<<<<<<  SWMM 4.3 (beta) COMBINE BLOCK DATA FILE >>>>>>>>>
*
*  Note, this file last updated by WCH, 4/22/94.
*
*	This is an input data file to the SWMM 4.3 Combine Block
*       for collating, combining and providing readable versions of
*       SWMM interface files, including both hydrograph/pollutograph
*       time series, and precipitation time series from the Rain Block.
*       All lines with an asterisk in column 1 are comment lines and are 
*       ignored by the program.
*
*       This file may be run as input to SWMM as long as interface files
*       RUNOFF.DNT and RUNOFFCB.DNT are present.
*
*       Input data are free format and may be up to 230 columns wide.  
*       You must have a value for every data column even if the program
*       will not actually use a given value.  There must be at least one
*       space or comma between every input value.  Alphanumeric data 
*       should be enclosed in single quotes. 
*
*       Caution!  Data lines that are "wrapped around" (continued on
*       two or more lines) should have a blank in column 1, unless a
*       card identifier is needed.  
*
*       SWMM uses both U.S. customary units and metric units.  The
*       examples use feet, cfs, acres, inches and inches/hour.  If metric
*       is specified substitute meters, cms, hectares, millimeters and
*       millimeters/hour.
*============================================================================
*	The SW card sets up the interface files to be used or created. 
*	There is one output file (#9) from the first run of Combine,
*       no output from the second run of Combine (ICOMB=5), and a second
*       output file (# 10) from the third run of Combine that creates
*       an ASCII file (ICOMB=4).  Interface files are ordinarily written  
*       in binary mode.  This special case (ICOMB=4) is the only instance 
*       in which an interface file can be viewed and read using a DOS
*       editor.

*   The MM card opens the scratch files to be used by different subroutines.
*   A certain number (1 for COMBINE) may be required for each block.

*============================================================================
*   In the example below, file RUNOFFCB.DNT is the same file as RUNOFF.DNT
*   and is simply a copy of RUNOFF.DNT.  Thus, the collated output file
*   will contain flows that are double those on the the input files.
*   After running this COMB.DOC file RUNCOMB.ASC is viewable with a 
*   DOS editor.  
*============================================================================
*     The @ command is used to permanently save an interface or 
*     scratch file.  This line should be placed before the first SWMM
*     block call.  The format of the @ command is as follows:
*============================================================================
*Column 1    Unit number of the       Name of the interface
*            interface file saved     file (any valid DOS filename)
*            or utilized

*  Column 1
*  $ANUM      Alphanumeric labeling of node names is used.  Enter
*             all requests for node numbers with names in quotes.
*             This option must be used if Combine is operating on
*             interface files created by earlier SWMM blocks using
*             the $ANUM option.

*                            and loads on new output interface file, JOUT.  
*                       = 1, Combine option.  Sum all flows and loads on
*                            interface files JIN and NSCRAT(1) and combine
