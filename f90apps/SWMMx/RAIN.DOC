*       <<<<<<<<  SWMM 4.3 RAIN BLOCK DATA FILE >>>>>>>>>
*
*  Note, this file last updated by WCH, 4/27/94.
*
*	This is an input data file to the SWMM 4.3 (beta) Rain Block for 
*       analyzing and creating a precipitation time series interface
*       file.  All lines with an asterisk in column 1 are comment lines 
*       and are ignored by the program.
*
*       Input data are free format and may be up to 230 columns wide.  
*       You must have a value for every data column even if the program
*       will not actually use a given value.  Alternatively, a slash, /, may
*       be used at the end of a line to indicate that remaining input
*       values should be filled with zeroes.  There must be at least one
*       space or comma between every input value.  Alphanumeric data 
*       should be enclosed in single quotes. 
*
*       Caution!  Data lines that are "wrapped around" (continued on
*       two or more lines) should have a blank in column 1, unless a
*       card identifier is needed.  
*
*       SWMM uses both U.S. customary units and metric units.  The
*       examples use feet, cfs, acres, inches and inches/hour.  If metric
*       is specified, substitute meters, cms, hectares, millimeters and
*       millimeters/hour.
*============================================================================
*	The SW line sets up the interface files to be used or created. 
*	There is one output file (#9 in this example) that will contain 
*       the hourly, 15 min. or other time interval precipitation data for 
*       subsequent blocks.

*   Note, the rainfall interface file is created on unit JOUT.  If this
*   file already exists and is referenced through an @ line, then rainfall
*   input during this Rain Block run will be combined with rainfall already
*   stored on the referenced file.  In this way, data from multiple gages
*   with different IDs may be stored on the same rainfall interface file. 
*============================================================================
*   The MM line opens the scratch files to be used by different subroutines.
*   A certain number (up to 4 for RAIN) is required for each block.

*     The @ command is used to permanently save an interface or

*
*       NOTE: Both hourly and 15-min. precipitation data may be analyzed
*       using IFORM = 0,1,4,6,9,10,11,12. 
*       When 15-min. data are analyzed, NSCRAT(4) is required.
*       Note, that when 15-min. data are processed, annual, storm event
*       and summary statistics are all based on hourly totals, not on the
*       individual 15-min. values.  However, the 15-min. values are 
*       properly stored on the interface file at 15-min. increments.
*       For IFORM = 0,1,4,6, the time interval (THISTO) is detected
*       from the NWS file.  It is not necessary to specify hourly or 
*       15-min.  
*
*       Only hourly data may be analyzed for IFORM = 2,5,7,8.
*
*       For IFORM = 3 (user defined) the time interval is arbitrary, but
*       1 hour or 15 min is recommended.  If the precipitation interval 
*       (THISTO) is greater than 1 hour, then annual summary statistics 
*       may be incorrect.  If THISTO < 1 hr, it should be an integer
*       divisor of 1 hr for proper annual and summary statistics. 
*     
*       Note, NOAA-NCDC precipitation data are given in terms of the 
*       ending time of a precipitation value, whereas SWMM needs the
*       beginning time of the precipitation increment.  Thus, times listed
*       in the print-outs and on the interface file will be one hyetograph
*       time interval (e.g., usually 1 hr or 15 min) earlier than the times
*       listed in the NOAA-NCDC files.  I.e., SWMM hours are 0-23 (0000-
*       2345 for 15-min. data), whereas NOAA-NCDC hours are 1-24 
*       (0015-2400 for 15-min. data).

*   Below is an example of a line that could be used to provide file
*   information to continue input for IFORM = 4 or 6.  The @ symbol should
*   be in the first column.  File NEWDATA.PRE would contain a 
*   continuation of Release B Condensed precipitation data,
*   including all the normal header information.  These data would follow
*   chronologically from prior data read in for this station.  The unit 
*   number, 4, is arbitrary but should not duplicate other unit numbers
*   listed on the SW or MM lines.

*	Line B2 defines the control information for a user-defined 
*               rainfall time series.  Required only if IFORM = 3 
*               on data group B1.  
*============================================================================
*  A maximum of 5000 precipitation values per year may be input in file JIN
*  (no limit on number of years), one value per line, each value with a date
*  and time (and optional station ID).  Note, 24 precipitation values per 
*  line may be entered according to special criteria through the use of
*  optional line B3, explained below.
*
*	B2 Line       :
*          THISTO     :  Rainfall time interval, minutes.
*          METRIC     :  Metric input/output.

*                        = 1, Use metric units, denoted by brackets [].

*                        = 1, volume, in. [mm].
*                        (Note: other units, e.g., hundredths of an inch,
*                        may be used by using CONV below.)
*          FIRMAT     :  Rainfall format (character data; enclose in single
*                        quotes).
*                        Should include integer fields for station number, 
*                        year, month, day, hour, minute and an F, E or G 
*                        field for rainfall.  Rainfall may not be read as
*                        integer (I-format) unless using B3 line -- see
*                        below.
*          CONV       :  Multiply by CONV to convert non-standard rainfall
*                        units to in./hr [mm/hr] (KUNIT = 0) or in. [mm] 
*                        (KUNIT = 1).  (Conversion should be to mm 
*                        if METRIC = 1.)
*
*                        NOTE: The value for the hour of precipitation should
*                        vary from zero (midnight) to 23 (11:00 p.m. = 2300). 
*                        E.g., hour = 2 and minute = 15 gives 0215 for the
*                        precipitation starting hour.  This is the 
*                        default procedure.  If desired, the hour can vary
*                        from 1 to 24 (midnight).  E.g., hour = 2 and minute
*                        = 15 gives 0115 for the precipitation starting 
*                        hour.  To choose this option (hour varying from
*                        1 to 24), enter CONV as a negative number
*                        (e.g., CONV = -1.0).  CONV will be reset in 
*                        the program to its correct positive value.
*
*          F1         :  Field position for station number.
*                        If F1 is zero a station number will not be read.
*          F2         :  Field position for year.  Required.
*          F3         :  Field position for month.  Required.
*          F4         :  Field position for day.  Required. 
*          F5         :  Field position for hour.  Required.
*          F6         :  Field position for minute.  Required.
*          F7         :  Field position for precipitation.  Required.
*                        Rainfall must be either first (1) or last (6 or 7)
*                        field.  SWMM considers positive numbers to be 
*                        rainfall and negative numbers to be snowfall.

*                       100th's of an inch (METRIC=0) or mm x 100 (METRIC=1).
*                       For example, an intensity of 0.2 in./hr should be 
*                       entered as 20 (METRIC=0), and an intensity of 30
*                       mm/hr should be entered as 3000 (METRIC=1).  
*                       *** Rainfall is read in integer format.***
*                       The integer format (e.g., 24I5) is included 
*                       in parameter FIRMAT on line B2.  There is no 
*                       multiplication by parameter CONV of these 
*                       data entries.  
*
*                       Note that by manipulation of the format specified
*                       in parameter FIRMAT, the data can be arranged 
*                       in groups of 12 values on two lines.  For instance, 
*                       if year, month and day occupy the first three fields
*                       of each line as real values, followed by 12 
*                       precipitation values as integers, the following
*                       FIRMAT is an example: '(3I4, 12I5,/,12X,12I5)'
*                       Of course, a field position may be left for
*                       a station number if need be.
