*
* Note, this file last updated by WCH, 4/21/94.
*
*	This is an input data file to the SWMM 4.3 (beta) Runoff Block for 
*       modeling watershed quantity and quality.  All lines with an 
*       asterisk in column 1 are comment lines and are ignored
*       by the program.
*
*       Input data are free format and may be up to 230 columns wide.  
*       You must have a value for every data column even if the program
*       will not actually use a given value.  A slash (/) may be used
*       to indicate that remaining fields should be filled with zeroes.
*       (See example for data group L1.)  A very common data input error is 
*       to accidentally omit required parameters at the end of a data group.  
*       There must be at least one space (or comma) between every input 
*       value.  
*
*       Caution!  Data lines that are "wrapped around" (continued on
*       two or more lines) should have a blank in column 1, unless a
*       card identifier is needed.  
*
*       Alphanumeric data ($ANUM option) should be enclosed in single 
*       quotes.  These include all references to subcatchment and
*       channel/pipe/inlet names.  
*
*       In general, SWMM parameters with names that begin with the letters
*       I,J,K,L,M,N are integers (e.g., NSCRAT() ), following the usual 
*       Fortran convention, and entered values must not include a 
*       decimal point.  
*
*       To avoid literary quotes being printed in output, use $NOQUOTE
*       after MM line.
*
*       SWMM uses both U.S. customary units and metric units.  The
*       examples use feet, cfs, acres, inches, inches/hour, and miles/hr.  
*       If metric is specified substitute meters, cms, hectares, 
*       millimeters, millimeters/hour, and km/hr.
*============================================================================
*	The SW card sets up the interface files to be used or created. 
*	There is one output file (#9) which will contain the time series
*       of flows and pollutant loads for subsequent blocks.

*
*  These lines, plus H5 lines, define triangular unit hydrographs (UH) 
*  to compute subcatchment I/I response from rainfall record on NSCRAT(1).
*  The response is computed before the time step simulation and stored on
*  NSCRAT(8) (required if this I/I procedure is used).  
*  An initial abstraction of up to DSTORE in [mm] is subtracted from
*  rainfall before computing rainfall excess at each time step.  The
*  initial abstraction is regenerated during dry weather at a rate of
*  DREC in/day [mm/day].  
*  Up to five sets of three triangular UHs may be input in the F4 lines.
*  Any subcatchment may use a fraction (defined on H5 lines) of flow 
*  produced from each of three UHs selected from any of the up to 
*  five sets input on the F4 lines.
*
*  The triangles are defined by TP = time to peak and K = ratio of recession
*  limb to TP, so that the time base = TP*(1+K).  Peak flow, Qp, is then 
*  calculated in the program so that the volume (area) of the triangle =
*  1 cfs/ac-in or 1 cms/ha-mm.
*  
*  Three triangles may be used (all starting at the same time) so that 
*  one may define a fast response, one a delayed response, and one a 
*  lengthy response, if desired.
*
*  The time step TSTEP (UH duration) must equal the rainfall time 
*  step (THISTO).  Rainfall can be input on the E-lines as usual, or 
*  rainfall already stored on NSCRAT(1) may be used, i.e., from prior 
*  Runoff or Rain Block runs.
*  Time step TSTEP2 is the time step used for computation of the UH 
*  response and should be an integer fraction of (or equal to) TSTEP.
*  TSTEP2 = WET time step in the Runoff Block is a good idea. 
*  There is a limit of 300 UH points for a given rainfall increment.  An 
*  error message is printed if this is exceeded, which can be caused by 
*  too long a time base and too short a value of TSTEP2.  
*  The RDII routine is designed to be compatible with the variable time
*  step used in the Runoff Block.  Values of I/I are linearly interpolated 
*  from the file on NSCRAT(8) at each time during the simulation.
*
*  H5 lines may be entered only for desired subcatchments.
*  If quality is simulated, constant concentrations for I/I are entered
*  on data line J6.

*      L2 line  :
*
*      If required, this line immediately follows each L1 line. 
*      Enter land use fractions for subcatchment on previous L1 line.
*      Not required if IMUL = 0 on line JJ (or line JJ omitted). 
*
*      If IMUL > 0, an L2 line must follow each L1 line, even if JLAND = 1.
*      The fractions on line L2 must total to exactly 1.0 (tolerance = 0.001). 
*
*      These fractions (PLAND) are used to multiply the subcatchment area
*      or curb length for all buildup calculations, depending on 
*      parameters JACGUT (line J2) and/or KACGUT (line J3).  
*      Similarly, if initial loads are input on line L1, the 
*      quantity/area values will be multiplied by the fraction area
*      for each land use.  Thus, the quantity/area values in line L1 cannot
*      differentiate between different land uses.  
*      Throughout the simulation, separate buildup and washoff parameters 
*      will be used for each land use fraction, as input in the multiple 
*      J3 lines.
*      If catchbasin quality information is entered, the total catchbasin
*      load for a subcatchment is the sum over the number of land uses of:
*      CBFACT*BASINS*CBVOL*PLAND.
*
*      Enter JLAND fractions.  Value 1 corresponds to land use 1, etc.
*
*      PLAND(1,N)  : Fraction of subcatchment N consisting of land use 1.
*      PLAND(2,N)  : Fraction of subcatchment N consisting of land use 2.
*       Etc.          Read JLAND values of PLAND.
