INTRODUCTION

The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is a comprehensive water
quantity and quality simulation model developed primarily for
urban areas.  Single-event and continuous simulation can be
performed for almost all components of the rainfall, runoff, and
quality cycles for a watershed.  The Extran Block of SWMM also
includes complete dynamic flow routing for hydraulic simulation
of dynamic backwater conditions, looped drainage networks,
surcharging, etc.

Version 4.30 of SWMM is an updated and improved release from
version 4.20 last released in May 1992.  New features include
natural channel cross sections in the Extran and Transport
Blocks, simulation of groundwater quantity in the Runoff Block,
variable time steps, easier access to long-term meteorological
data, and many adaptations for microcomputer use, including use
of free-format input.  For a list of modifications since the last
release, refer to the files RELEASE.TXT and UPDATE.TXT (refer to
FILE NAME AND CONTENT section).

The model is designed for use by engineers and scientists
experienced in urban hydrological and water quality processes. 
Although the two user's manuals explain most computational
algorithms, an engineering background is necessary to appreciate
most methods being used and to verify that the model results are
reasonable.

     NOTE:  For convenience, the terms "SWMM model system"
     or "SWMM" will be used in this document to refer to the
     SWMM model and all associated support files and
     programs as a single unit.  Therefore, the term "SWMM"
     is synonymous with "SWMM model system" for purposes of
     this document.

ABSTRACT

                            Summary

The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was originally developed
for the EPA between 1969 and 1971 (1) and was the first
comprehensive model of its type for urban runoff analysis. 
Maintenance and improvements to SWMM led to Version 2 in 1975,
Version 3 in 1981 and now Version 4 (2,3).  Version 4.30 of SWMM
(May 1994) is the latest edition of this comprehensive computer
model for analysis of quantity and quality problems associated
with urban runoff.

Both single-event and continuous simulation may be performed on
catchments having storm sewers, or combined sewers and natural
drainage, for prediction of flows, stages and pollutant
concentrations.  The Extran Block (3) solves the complete dynamic
flow routing equations (Saint Venant equations) for accurate
simulation of backwater, looped connections, surcharging, and
pressure flow.  Using SWMM, the modeler can simulate all aspects
of the urban hydrologic and quality cycles, including rainfall,
snowmelt, surface and subsurface runoff, flow routing through the
drainage network, storage and treatment.  Statistical analyses
may be performed on long-term precipitation data and on output
from continuous simulation.

The model may be used for both planning and design.  The planning
mode is used for an overall assessment of the urban runoff
problem and proposed abatement options.  This mode is typified by
continuous simulation for several years using long-term
precipitation data.  Catchment schematization is usually "coarse"
in keeping with the planning level of analysis.  The Statistics
Block may be used for frequency analysis of the long term time
series of hydrographs and pollutographs and for identification of
individual hydrologic events that may be of special interest.  A
design-level, event simulation also may be run using a detailed
catchment schematization and shorter time steps for precipitation
input.  The Rain Block is used for processing of hourly and
15-minute precipitation time series for input to continuous
simulation.  This block also incorporates the statistical
analysis procedures of the EPA SYNOP model (4,5) for
characterization of storm events.  The Statistics Block may
alternatively be used for statistical analysis of the
precipitation time series.

Although the historical basis of the model was for analysis of
urban runoff quality problems, the model often is used just for
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis.  The Extran Block has proven
especially valuable for sophisticated hydraulic analysis of urban
drainage networks.  An option for both the Extran (Saint Venant
equations) and Transport (kinematic wave equations) Blocks is use
of natural channel cross-section data in the same form as
required by the Hydrologic Engineering Center's HEC2 program.  In
this manner, Extran can perform a dynamic backwater analysis.

The model is designed for use by engineers and scientists
experienced in urban hydrological and water quality processes. 
Although the two user's manuals explain most computational
algorithms, an engineering background is necessary to appreciate
most methods being used and to verify that the model results are
reasonable.

SWMM Version 4 is microcomputer based (DOS-compatible), although
the Fortran code may be compiled on any machine.  Execution times
are on the order of a few seconds to several minutes for most
jobs on a 386/486 machine.  However, simulation of large areas
with many subcatchments and/or channels for many time steps can
require several hours on a microcomputer.  The user is well
advised to use the most powerful microcomputer available.

                      Data Requirements

For hydrologic simulation in the Runoff Block, data requirements
include area, imperviousness, slope, roughness, width (a shape
factor), depression storage, and infiltration parameters for
either the Horton or Green-Ampt equations for up to 100
subcatchments.  (Number of subcatchments, pipes, etc. is variable
depending on the compilation).  The program is driven by
precipitation for up to ten gages (distributed spatially), and
evaporation.  Additional data are required if simulation of
snowmelt, subsurface drainage, and infiltration/inflow options
are employed.  The subsurface drainage option is especially
useful in locations where true overland flow rarely occurs
because of flat, sandy soils.

Flow routing can be performed in the Runoff, Transport and Extran
Blocks, in increasing order of sophistication.  Input data
include shape and dimensions of closed conduits and open
channels, slope, roughness; and for Extran, invert and ground
surface elevations.  Additional information is required for the
description of weirs, orifices, pumps and storage, if simulated. 
Extran can also simulate dynamic boundary conditions, e.g.,
tides.  Storage-indication routing may be performed in the
Transport and Storage/Treatment Blocks, with appropriate data on
volume vs. outflow.

Quality processes are initiated in the Runoff Block and include
options for constant concentration, regression of load vs. flow,
and buildup washoff, with the latter requiring the most data (6). 
Additional options include street cleaning, erosion, and quality
contributions from precipitation, catchbasins, adsorption, and
base flow.  EPA Nationwide Urban Runoff Program (7) data are
often used as starting values for quality computations.  Quality
routing in subsequent blocks (except for Extran) requires few
additional data, except for the Storage/Treatment Block in which
several removal processes can be simulated.

Depending upon the simulation objective, input data requirements
can be minimal to extensive.  For simulation of a complete
drainage network data collection can be accomplished within a few
days, but reducing the data for input to the model may take up to
3 person-weeks for a large area (e.g., greater than about 2000
acres).  For an Extran simulation of sewer hydraulics, expensive
and time consuming field verification of sewer invert elevations
often is required.  However, most data reduction, such as
tabulation of elevations, lengths and dimensions, is
straightforward.  Blocks may be used in series or individually. 
For example, the user may generate inlet hydrographs by means
other than SWMM and then use only the SWMM flow routing options. 
SWMM interfacing requirements are clearly defined.  E.g., output
may be directed to the EPA WASP receiving water model (8).

Calibration data consist of measured hydrographs and
pollutographs for use in establishing values of input parameters
for which a priori estimates are insufficient.  It is often
possible to obtain good agreement between predicted and measured
hydrographs with little calibration effort.  This is not true for
quality simulation for which calibration data are essential to
obtain credible simulations of pollutographs.  Without such
measured concentrations and loads, SWMM quality simulation is at
best only suited for relative comparisons between control
strategies and should not be relied upon for prediction of
absolute magnitudes of concentrations and loads (9,6).  No firm
numbers can be given for the required amount of calibration and
verification events, but six of each should provide a robust
calibration and verification.

                            Output

Basic SWMM output consists of hydrographs and pollutographs
(concentration vs. time) at any desired location in the drainage
system.  Depths and velocities are also available as are summary
statistics on surcharging, volumes, continuity and other quantity
parameters.  Additional quality output includes loads, source
identification, continuity, residuals (e.g., sludge), and other
parameters.  The Statistics Block may be used to separate
hydrographs and pollutographs into storm events and then compute
statistics on parameters such as volume, duration, intensity,
interevent time, load, average concentration, and peak
concentration.  A hydraulic design routine in the Transport Block
will re-size conduits to pass peak flows.  Either metric or U.S.
customary units may be used.

Most output is tabular.  Microcomputer graphics are accessed
through exports to spreadsheets or other graphics packages and
through third party software for pre- and post-processing.  The
latter includes options for dynamic plots of the hydraulic grade
line produced by the Extran Block.  Linkages have also been
prepared to geographic information systems (10,11).

                  Assumptions and Limitations

The two user's manuals clearly explain almost all computational
assumptions of the model, several of which have been mentioned in
preceding paragraphs.  The model performs best in urbanized areas
with impervious drainage, although it has been widely used
elsewhere.  Quantity simulations are enhanced by the
calibration/verification process, but can be expected to resemble
measured data fairly accurately if good information is known
about area, imperviousness and rainfall.  Quality simulations
must be calibrated in order to be credible in terms of absolute
magnitudes (9,6).

Technical limitations include lack of subsurface quality routing
(a constant concentration is used), no interaction of quality
processes (apart from adsorption), difficulty in simulation of
wetlands quality processes (except as can be represented as
storage processes), and a weak scour deposition routine in the
Transport Block.  The biggest impediment to model usage is the
user interface, with its lack of menus and graphical output.  The
model is still run in a batch mode (the user constructs an input
file with an editor), unless third-party software is used for
pre- and post-processing.

                      Application History

SWMM has an impressive longevity.  It has been used in scores of
U.S. cities as well as extensively in Canada, Europe, Australia
and elsewhere (12).  A large body of literature on theory and
case studies is available, partly documented in a bibliography of
SWMM-related publications (13) and elsewhere (6,12).  The model
has been used for very complex hydraulic analysis for combined
sewer overflow mitigation as well as for many stormwater
management planning studies and pollution abatement projects, and
there are many instances of successful calibration and
verification.  Because of its public domain status, extensive
feedback has been received from users on needed corrections and
enhancements, and the model is continuously updated through
interaction with CEAM.

FILE NAME AND CONTENT

The self-extracting, interactive executable program file on the
distribution diskettes exists in a compressed format to save
diskette space and file transfer time.  This section contains a
description of each file that can be decompressed from the
compressed distribution file.

Follow the instructions on the first distribution diskette label
to install, decompress (extract), and restore file(s) to their
original name and size in order to place the SWMM model system in
a usable format on a hard or virtual disk.  For comparison
purposes, the original date and time of creation are also
restored with each file.

     NOTE:  Execution of the INSTALL or INSTALSW command can
     extract one or more SWMM model system files.  These
     files are automatically stored into DOS sub-directories
     on the hard disk.  The sub-directory structure, under
     which the sub-directories shown below are stored, is
     selected by the user during execution of the INSTALL or
     INSTALSW program.  The string "InstallationDirectory"
     will be used to denote the highest level default
     installation directory structure chosen by the user
     during execution of INSTALL or INSTALSW.  Below the
     installation directory, all files are grouped and
     listed by the appropriate DOS sub-directory name.

               section).  This file is read automatically during
               execution of the SWMM model system executable task
               image file (*.EXE) if an error is detected during
               execution.

SWMM.BAT     - DOS batch command file used to execute the SWMM 
               model.  To execute, type

               SWMM

               at the DOS system prompt, press the <Enter> key,
               then respond to the prompts displayed on the
               monitor screen.  For further information and
               options on executing SWMM, refer to the ROUTINE
               EXECUTION section.

SWMM.SCR     - Initial welcome and CEAM information screen 
               displayed before the execution of the SWMM model
               by the DOS batch command file SWMM.BAT.  This is
               an ASCII text file that can be displayed on the
               monitor screen with the DOS TYPE command or
               printed using the DOS PRINT command.

XSWMMX.EXE   - Executable task image file for the SWMM model.

                    WARNING:  This task image file
                    (XSWMMX.EXE) should only be executed
                    using the DOS batch command file
                    provided (SWMM.BAT).

*.DOC        - Annotated, example, input data (template) files to
               test the installation and demonstrate application
               of the SWMM model and its different blocks (one
               for each block).  These data files are also
               furnished to provide instruction by example and
               can be used as templates for the preparation of
               new input files.  To test installation, execute
               the SWMM model using each file as the name of an
               input file.  The model interactively prompts the
               user for the input file name.  These files may
               refer to other data and interface files (refer to
               *.DNT, *.DOT files).

     NOTE:  Differences between version 4.30 and earlier
     version 4.xx release versions and updates/changes to
     the user manuals (refer to DOCUMENTATION section) are
     documented within the *.DOC files.  These files are
     especially important for changes in input formats that
     differ from those listed in the user manuals (refer to
     DOCUMENTATION section).

               These are ASCII (non-binary) text files that can
               be displayed on the monitor screen with the DOS
               TYPE command or printed using the DOS PRINT
               command.  These files can also be viewed or edited
               using any editor program that can read and save a
               file to disk in ASCII text format.

     NOTE:  A file name path specification and/or file name,
     as typed by the user, must be a unique and valid DOS
     path and/or file name.  An input file name must also be
     a valid SWMM model input data file name -- either
     furnished with the distribution package or created,
     designated, and named by the user.  A file name used as
     input data for the SWMM model will be processed and
     executed in the run of the model.  Remember, a DOS file
     name can be from 1 to 8 characters and can have an
     optional 1 to 3 character file name extension.

     NOTE:  Refer to the explanation of the *.OUT files for
     a procedure to compare the contents of an output file
     produced on the users system to an output file provided
     with the distribution release.  The SWMM model
     interactively prompts the user for the output file
     name.

*.DNT        - Auxiliary interface and extra input data files
*.DOT          needed by *.DOC files and read automatically by 
               the SWMM model.

SWDAT1.DAT   - Two additional example, input data files to test
SWDAT4.DAT     the installation and demonstrate application of 
               the SWMM model.  These data files can be used to
               create the TRANS1.DNT and RUNOFF6.DNT interface
               files that are needed to execute the SWMM model
               using the input files GRAPH.DOC and STATS.DOC.

NWSTMP.DAT   - Interface files required to run test input data
NWSPPT.DAT     files SWDAT1.DAT and SWDAT4.DAT.  These files will 
               be automatically read during the execution of the
               SWMM model.


**  Sub-directory InstallationDirectory\OUTPUT:

*.OUT        - Output listing files, one for each SWMM block, 
               produced by the SWMM model using the test input
               data files that are provided on the distribution
               diskettes.  After executing the SWMM model with
               each test data file, compare the contents of the
               output file produced (e.g., RUNOFF.OUT) with the
               corresponding *.OUT output file provided within
               the sub-directory OUTPUT (e.g.,
               OUTPUT/RUNOFF.OUT).  To compare file contents, use
               the COMP (PC DOS) or FC (MS DOS) file compare
               command, or print both files then compare contents
               by hand.  For further information and options on
               executing the SWMM model, refer to file SWMM.BAT
               in this section or to the ROUTINE EXECUTION
               section.

     NOTE:  The symbol "<Enter>" represents pressing the
     <Enter> or carriage return key.  Responses and key
     strokes that can be typed by the user are underlined
     with the hyphen character (-) and/or enclosed by the
     angle bracket characters (<>).

               Example SWMM interactive (non-batch) execution and
               file comparison sequence:

               1)   Set the default drive to the disk containing
               the SWMM model system sub-directory:

               A:\> C:<Enter>
                    --

               2)   Change the DOS default sub-directory to the
               sub-directory designated by the user during the
               installation program as the installation sub-
               directory (e.g., SWMM).  Use the DOS CD (change
               directory) command at the DOS system prompt:

               C:\> CD \SWMM<Enter>
                    --------

               3)   Execute the SWMM model with a selected test
               input data file:

ROUTINE EXECUTION

     NOTE:  The symbol "<Enter>" represents pressing the
     <Enter> or carriage return key.  Responses and key
     strokes that can be typed by the user are underlined
     with the hyphen character (-) and/or enclosed by the
     angle bracket characters (<>).

     NOTE:  It is possible that the SWMM model system could
     be incompatible with MS DOS and Windows software cache
     files SMARTDRV.SYS or SMARTDRV.EXE loaded from the
     system configuration files \CONFIG.SYS and/or
     \AUTOEXEC.BAT on the boot drive.  If any portion of the
     SWMM model system prematurely halts, produces unusual
     results, and/or causes the host system to halt or hang,
     remove any SMARTDRV statements on the boot drive
     \CONFIG.SYS and/or \AUTOEXEC.BAT files, then re-boot
     the system to implement these changes before attempting
     to reuse any portion the SWMM model system.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Complete the installation process to make the full or any portion
of the SWMM model system and related files resident on a hard
(usually designated as "C:") or virtual disk drive.  Then modify
the \CONFIG.SYS system environment file and restart the
microcomputer system.  This needs to be completed only once for a
given installation of the SWMM model system.

General Execution Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are four basic phases in using the SWMM model.  Phase one
is to create a SWMM input data file.  Instructions are provided
in the two user manuals (refer to DOCUMENTATION section) and the
example input files provided on the distribution diskettes can be
used as an example and/or template file that can be modified. 
The input file must be created manually using a text editor or
word processor (non-document mode) that can save a file in ASCII
text (non-binary) format.

     NOTE:  Caution!  Refer to *.DOC files for changes to
     the user manual concerning the SWMM model input file
     format requirements.

In phase two, verify that the SWMM model executable task image
file (XSWMMX.EXE), DOS batch command file SWMM.BAT, Lahey FORTRAN
run time error message file (F77L3.EER), SWMM initial welcome and
CEAM information screen (SWMM.SCR), input data file, and
interface file(s) (optional) are in the current default DOS sub-
directory.  It is convenient but not required to have the above
files in the same sub-directory.

     NOTE:  To execute the SWMM model system from any sub-
     directory located on a hard or virtual disk drive, add
     the SWMM installation sub-directory (e.g., C:\SWMM) to
     the DOS search PATH.  One way to accomplish this is to
     add or modify the PATH statement in the system start-up
     file, AUTOEXEC.BAT (located in the root directory on
     the start-up or boot drive).  For example

     PATH C:\;C:\DOS;C:\UTIL;C:\WP51;C:\SWMM

     Refer to the DOS Reference Manual for PATH command and
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file application and use.

Any interface file will be assumed to be in the current or
default sub-directory unless otherwise assigned using the @
function in the input data file.  Be sure that there is
sufficient space on the disk for generation of output and
interface files.

Phase three requires the user to execute the SWMM model (refer to
"Routine Execution Steps" for further information).  During
execution of any block, run-time status messages will appear on
the monitor indicating the progress of the program, including the
current time step.

In phase four the user views the output file produced by the
execution of the SWMM model.  SWMM program output can be viewed
by scrolling through the output file created by the block that
was executed and named by the user.  A word processor or text
editor is convenient for this purpose, or the command

                    TYPE filename.ext | MORE

can be used where "filename.ext" is the name of the output file
selected by the user (e.g., RUNOFF.OUT).  However, the TYPE
command is awkward for the majority of the output that exceeds
the usual 80-column screen width.

Alternatively, the output file can be printed.  A compressed
print mode (132 column) should be used to avoid awkward--wrapped
around--output from lines that exceed 80 columns.  The DOS MODE
command may be used for this purpose.  For a parallel printer
assigned to LPT1, the DOS command

                        MODE LPT1: 132

will cause most printers to print in compressed mode.  The
Combine Block with parameter ICOMB = 4 can be used to generate an
ASCII text (non-binary) file containing viewable hydrographs and
pollutographs on the interface file.  These time series can be
imported or input to a spread-sheet for graphing.  The process
can be automated using DOS batch files and spreadsheet macros. 
For further information, refer to the DOS Reference Manual or the
spreadsheet software user manual(s).

Routine Execution Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step Description/Action
~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1)   Set the default drive to the disk containing the SWMM model 
     system sub-directory:

     A:\> C:<Enter>
          --

2)   Change the DOS default sub-directory to the sub-directory 
     designated by the user during the installation program as
     the installation sub-directory (e.g., SWMM).  Use the DOS CD
     (change directory) command at the DOS system prompt:

     C:\> CD \SWMM<Enter>
          --------

3)   To execute the SWMM model, type:

     C:\SWMM> SWMM<Enter>
              ----
     (SWMM banner/registration screen displayed here...press
     <Enter> key to clear screen and continue model execution...)

     After an opening banner/registration screen is displayed on
     the monitor, press the <Enter> key to clear the screen and
     continue model execution.  The model will begin prompting
     the user for information needed for this run of the model.

     The DOS command line syntax to execute the SWMM model is

     SWMM [input-file-name [output-file-name]]

     where input-file-name and output-file-name are optional
     command line arguments for the SWMM model input and output
     file names that must be specified by the user.  If the input
     and output file names, or the output file name are not
     specified on the SWMM command line, then one or both of the
     following prompts will be displayed on the monitor after the
     opening banner/registration screen:

     Type input file name, then press <Enter> -> RUNOFF.DOC<Enter>
                                                 ----------
     Type output file name, then press <Enter> -> RUNOFF.OUT<Enter>
                                                  ----------

     The response to these prompts can include an optional drive
     and/or path for the file name entered (e.g.,
     C:\SWMM\TESTDATA\RUNOFF.DOC, A:MYDATA.OUT).

     A common problem is for the SWMM executable file to be
     unable to locate a file because it assumes the file is on
     the default drive and/or sub-directory when it is not.  If
     input, output, and/or interface files are not on the default
     drive and sub-directory, the user must type a drive and/or
     path name ahead of the file name.  For interface files this
     is only possible by using the @-function.  For further
     information refer to the "File Name and Path Specifications"
     sub-section later in this document or to Chapter 2 of the
     User's Manual.

     Interface files created by blocks included in the SWMM model
     (e.g., Runoff) for use by Extran (and vice versa) can be
     saved between runs by using the @ symbol, as described in
     Section 2 of the SWMM user's manual.  The format of the @
     command is

     Column 1    Unit number of the       Name of the interface
                 interface file saved     file (any valid DOS filename)
                 or utilized

     @            15                       'RUNOFF1.INT'

     This line is format free and is inserted between the MM data
     line and the data line describing the name of the first SWMM
     block to be called by the program.  The unit number is any
     integer excluding 5, 6 or 55 and should correspond to a unit
     number entered on the SW data line or MM data line.  In the
     above example, unit 15 could correspond to the output
     interface file created by the Runoff Block and identified by
     a JOUT parameter on the SW data line.  More than one @
     command can be used.

Pausing During Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SWMM execution can be paused by pressing the <Ctrl><S> or <Pause>
keys.  The user can press any key to resume execution.  Execution
can be prematurely and permanently halted (aborted) by pressing
the <Ctrl><C> or <Ctrl><Break> keys.

Run Time Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The user should be aware that if the program stops suddenly
leaving the DOS prompt on the screen, an error has most likely
been generated from within the SWMM program.  This error can be
seen by looking at the end of the SWMM output file and usually
points to the problem.  The most common SWMM-generated error is
the following:

You had an error in your input data.
Did you include enough values of zeroes for all parameters on an
input line??  The program attempted to read line --> B2 and this
is an echo of what it found:
'B2' 0  0

===> Run ended due to input error(s) in either the
     above line or the previous line.

This error usually indicates an insufficient number of parameters
on the indicated input line or somewhere prior to it.  If there
are not enough parameters, the program almost inevitably
encounters a mis-match between a required variable type (e.g.,
integer instead of real), and an error message will result. 
Sometimes the error is caused by an insufficient number of
parameters several lines previously.  In the above example,
another zero is required on line B2 of the Runoff Block.

File Name and Path Specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A file name, path specification, and/or the parameter file name
argument "filename.ext" must be a unique and valid DOS path
and/or file name.  The user response "filename.ext" must also be
a valid SWMM model system input or output file name -- either
furnished with the distribution package (refer to FILE NAME AND
CONTENT section) or created, designated, and named by the user. 
A file name used as input data for any program and/or model in
the SWMM model system will be processed and executed in that run
of the program or model.

File names used for the input data and/or output listing files
(except for the test input and output cases provided) are
arbitrary, but must follow the rules for DOS file names.  A file
name should assist the user with identifying the contents or
purpose of a file (e.g., INPUT.DAT, OUTPUT.LST).

Any file name can be from 1 to 8 characters and can have an
optional 1 to 3 character file name extension.  Any characters
beyond 8 in the file name or beyond 3 in the file name extension
will be truncated by the DOS operating system.  Refer to the DOS
Reference Manual for further information on file names and disk
file input/output procedures, rules, and commands.

RUN TIME AND PERFORMANCE

The following run times (approximate) were observed using the
test data files furnished with the distribution version of the
SWMM model system.  Remember that these times were obtained using
test data files that may not be representative of a "real world"
problem and/or data.  The test data files have been furnished for
testing the installation of the SWMM model system and for
instruction by example.

In general, these input test data files are not intended to be
representative of full scale model simulations.  They were
developed to test the installation of significant sections of
model code.

The run times listed in the table below were produced on a
Microway 80486 B2T EISA class microcomputer running under MS DOS
5.0 and using 640k bytes of random access (low end) memory (RAM),
32 megabytes of extended memory, a 32 megabyte virtual (RAM)
disk, Microp 1624-15 SCSI 765 megabyte DPT EISA hard disk with
512K byte cache SCSI controller, a 256K byte memory cache, a 50
megahertz clock, a Number Smasher-860 40 megahertz, 32 megabyte
math numerical coprocessor, and an ATI Ultra Graphics 1 megabyte
video card.

     GRAPH.DOC              00:00:09

Program run time and performance can be affected by many
microcomputer system and program parameters including

     o available disk space
     o available memory
     o CONFIG.SYS file options and parameter values
     o disk and/or file storage and/or fragmentation
