Corrections and Changes Between Versions 4.21 and 4.30:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE:  Changes/corrections 1 through 5 were made by CEAM, May 1994.  Changes
       and/or corrections 6 through 113 are listed in cronological order.

1)   Updated and modified READ.ME file for release of version 4.30.

2)   Upgraded and modified INSTALIT/MediaBuilder code and logic for release
     of version 4.30 to include additional system hardware/software checks
     and installation options.

3)   Compiled and linked SWMM model using Lahey FORTRAN 32-bit, protected
     mode compiler and Phar-lap linker.

4)   Implemented FORTRAN source code changes to correct minor problems that
     occured during compilation and/or execution due to use of Lahey FORTRAN
     development tools or CEAM Systems Development Life Ccycle Methodology
     (SDLCM) Statement of Policy, Standards, and Guidelines.

5)   Increased storage capacity and parameterization as follows:

     From FORTRAN source code include file TAPES.INC:

     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~   ~~~
     PLUGS DIMENSION (NPLUG)...................................... 200  2000

6)   Natural channel cross sections.  This program will read data and perform
     the calculations.

7)   Combine.  DELT and related parameters have been made single precision
     to correspond to other blocks.

8)   Typo correction in HTIDES.FOR.

9)   Check for equal VRATE values for Type 3 pumps in Extran.

10)  Metric units conversion corrections in TEMP and GTCOLD for user input of
     temperature and evaporation.

11)  Metric conversion correction in INFIL.

12)  Input units correction in CATCH for groundwater routine.

13)  Correction to TSTORG and TSTRDT for maintaining data for second power
     function outlet for all S/T devices.

14)  Metric conversion correction to PRINTQ.

15)  Correction to SNOWIN and WSHED for reading evaporation time series input
     to TEMP.

16)  Correction to GUTTER for groundwater continuity check.

17)  Correction for possible divide error in STATS.

18)  Miscellaneous corrections for spelling and messages.  It is possible to
     limit the number of non-convergence messages from the groundwater
     routine by adding a fourth parameter to the B2 line in Runoff.  This
     parameter is the number of messages to be printed, and may be omitted
     without causing an input error.

19)  Correction to Extran (and Transport) for calculation of hydraulic radius
     for irregular (natural) channels with vertical sides, e.g., a rectangular
     channel.  An error in Subroutine GETCUR had resulted in a hydraulic
     radius that was too high for irregular channels that included vertical
     segments.

20)  Correction to Rain Block for incorrect February-March date calculations.

21)  Correction to Runoff Block groundwater routine for error when
     infiltration was returned to ground surface and for bad iterative
     solution leading to negative deep percolation.

22)  Correction to Extran to read J4 line with NTIDE=5 according to User's
     Manual description.  

23)  Correction to Subroutine TRANS to have the Transport Block write in
     metric units to the interface file when metric units are being used.

24)  Corrections to Subroutines QHYDRO and QINT involving I/O and use of land
     use fractions input in data group L2.

25)  Correction to Subroutine DATED to fix conversion from time in seconds to
     hour/minute/second.  Error had caused negative seconds just before
     change to new hour.

26)  Correction to Subroutine INDAT3 to add initial date (IDATEZ) to Extran
     initiation.  This allows Extran to read another Extran interface file.

27)  Modification to Subroutine CATCH to print warning message and reset
     imperviousness to 100 % if value entered is > 100%.  This can occur,
     for example, if ratios are used and accidentally create modified
     imperviousness > 100 %.

NOTE:  Modification numbers 28-33 and several others are courtesy of
Robert E. Dickinson = RED of XP Software, Tampa, FL, 813/886-7724.

28)  Correction to S1.INC (common block) of the Storage/Treatment Block to
     remove double precision declaration from parameter DS.  This corrects
     timing errors that made S/T incompatible with interface file.

29)  Minor correction to Subroutine SNOWIN so that it prints correct error
     message.

30)  Correction to Subroutines INITAL and DWLOAD to avoid setting NITER = 1
     when storage units are used in Transport.  This error caused different
     pipe routing in Transport when storage units were included.

31)  Correction to Subroutine COMBIN to remove double precision from TDIFF
     and DIFF that may have caused timing problems. (RED, 6/1/93)

32)  Correction to Subroutine HYDRO for timing problem for continuous
     simulations that exceed rainfall duration by large amount. (RED, 6/1/93)

33)  Correction to Subroutines GETCUR and INTRAN to read and process natural
     channel data from the Transport Block correctly. (RED, 6/2/93)

34)  Correction to Subroutine TRANSX for check for surface flooding in
     Extran, based on CDM correction (Chuck Moore).  May lead to lower
     continuity errors when surface flooding occurs during surcharging.
     (7/14/93)

35)  Modifications to Statistics Block subroutines STATS, SBTABL and POINTS
     and STCOM.INC to: 1) correct headings (i.e., years vs. months for return
     period) and misc. minor format changes; 2) compute return period for
     plots using same method (using parameter "A") as for tables; 3) change
     units for average and max. flow to cfs (cms) from cf/hr (m^3/hr); 4)
     warn about small return periods (simulation period < 1 yr or mo); 5)
     correct plots to be sure data are sorted prior to plotting; 6) change
     max. no. of events back to 4000 as listed in user's manual. (7/22/93)

36)  Correction to Subroutine GROUND to use correct derivative in iterative
     scheme (Brett Cunningham, CDM). (7/27/93)

37)  Correction to Subroutine GQUAL to alter channel/pipe quality routing in
     the Runoff Block during surcharge conditions.  This correction maintains
     a constant concentration for conditions for which this is desired, e.g.,
     only quality loading is from precipitation.  The quality continuity
     error is also reduced.  The quality continuity error can be reduced
     further only by reducing the time step. (7/28/93)

38)  Correction to Subroutine GQUAL for computation of exponential argument
     during quality flow routing. (7/28/93)

39)  Modification to Runoff Block quality (Subroutines QINT and QSHED, plus
     QUALTY.INC) to maintain loadings as a function of landuse fractions
     for subcatchments when land use fractions are entered in data group L2.
     Previously, the buildup parameters were constant (last values read in
     for each pollutant/land use combination) for each subcatchment after
     the pre-simulation buildup. (7/29/93)

40)  Addition of error message to Subroutine COMBIN to warn of possible error
     consisting of trying to read numeric node number when should be reading
     alphanumeric node name (i.e., while using $ANUM option). (8/2/93)

41)  Correct Subroutine STRT for proper metric conversion when writing to
     the interface file and metric units are used in the Storage/Treatment
     Block. (Rob James, 8/4/93)

42)  Correction to interface file handling in Subroutine GRAPH (update
     counter, i.e., subscripts, for JIN/JOUT files).  This allows operation
     of the Graph Block in separate runs (not just as part of an overall SWMM
     run).  Also install error message regarding file handling and install
     no-quote option in the Graph Block.  (Use of $NOQUOTE at beginning of
     SWMM input avoids display of various quotes/sayings from literature.)
     (8/5/93)

43)  Modification of Subroutine SNOWIN to permit use of alphanumeric
     subcatchment names (using $ANUM option) when using snowmelt routines.
     (8/5/93)

44)  Message about quality continuity added to Subroutine PRPOLL. (8/6/93)

45)  Option in the Rain Block to read current EarthInfo ASCII files of hourly
     and 15-min. precipitation (Subroutines RAIN, GTRAIN, G9RAIN and
     PRECIP.INC).  See RAIN.DOC file.  Several corrections to permit correct
     processing of 15-min. precipitation (place 15-min. precip. on interface
     file in 15-min. increments, instead of hourly totals as done before).
     (8/20/93)

46)  Correction of negative sign in Subroutine HORTON for correct
     regeneration of Horton infiltration during continuous simulation.
     (Steve Merrill, Brown and Caldwell, 8/20/93)

NOTE:  Changes 47-53 are due to Chuck Moore, CDM, Annandale, VA.

47)  Deletion of unnecessary assignment statements in Subroutines MAIN,
     GRAPH, RHYDRO1. (CDM, 8/23/93)

48)  Realignment of some variables in Common statements in S1.INC and LAB.INC
     (to make compatible with Lahey Fortran). (CDM, 8/23/93)

49)  Insertion of zero divide check in Subroutine FIRST. (CDM, 8/23/93)

50)  Check for subscript out of range and wrong data lines while reading R1
     lines in Subroutine TRANS and G lines in Subroutine TSTRDT (Transport
     Block). (CDM, 8/23/93)

51)  On-screen print of continuity error in Subroutine TRANS. (CDM, 8/23/93)

52)  Modification to MAIN.FOR to allow optional input of input and output
     file names on SWMM command line.  Includes addition of Subroutine CLINE
     and CCLNAME.INC. (CDM, 8/23/93)
     E.g., type: XSWMMA MYFILE.DAT MYFILE.OUT

53)  Addition of Type 26 Tabular Flow Divider in the Transport Block.  This
     flow divider uses a table of inflow vs. undiverted outflow values to
     split flow between undiverted and diverted pathways downstream.  See
     TRANS.DOC for explanation.  Altered subroutines include TRANS, INTRAN,
     FIRST, ROUTE, TRBLK and new subroutine RSPLIT, plus changes to Common
     statements in several .INC files. (CDM, 8/23/93)

54)  Correction to Subroutine STRT to read more than 5 date intervals for
     detailed print-outs on Storage/Treatment line C2.  New maximum is 45.
     (8/30/93)

55)  Add Parameter statement to Subroutine UNIT to facilitate changing
     allowable number of plugs in Storage/Treatment quality routing.
     Increase allowable number of plugs to 200 (from 50).  Users who run up
     against this limit have option of recompiling with larger limit or
     increasing the size of the S/T time step. (8/31/93)

56)  Added provision to print summary statistics for subcatchments and
     channel/pipes in the Runoff Block.  Changes affect Subroutines HYDRO,
     WSHED and others.  Two new subroutines added: SMSTAT, WSTAT, plus
     RUNSTAT.INC. (CDM, 9/3/93)

57)  Added option to generate rainfall-dependent infiltration/inflow (RDII)
     to Runoff Block simulations.  This procedure involves new input in lines
     F3,F4 and H5 and uses groups of triangular unit hydrographs to generate
     flows from the rainfall record as a function of the sewered area for
     desired subcatchments.  See RUNOFF.DOC for details.  Changes made to
     several subroutines, plus new subroutines RDIIREAD, RDIIRES, RDIISHED,
     READNEXT and RDII.INC. (CDM, 9/3/93)

58)  Corrected IDECID = 0 option in the Rain Block (Subroutine RAIN) to cease
     calculation of precipitation statistics with this option, thus avoiding
     any limit on the number of storms, hence number of years, that can be
     processed. (9/7/93)

59)  Added end-of-file message to Subroutine INFACE for better error message
     when reading interface file headers. (9/8/93)

60)  Numerous corrections to fix miscellaneous small errors, including
     computation of correct running time for very long simulations
     (TIMER.INC); scale adjustment for STCHL and STCHR for variable cross
     sections (GETCUR); correction to S/T pump routine to produce correct
     shut-off (TSTORG); corrections to GROUND for subsurface flow iterations;
     correction for snow quality calculations (QSHED); metric corrections in
     S/T, Transport and Runoff Blocks (CONTRL, INTRAN, QHYDRO, WSHED, and
     RHYDRO1); surcharge correction in Runoff (GUTNR); and other minor
     corrections in several subroutines. (Bob Dickinson and Warren Chrusciel,
     9/30/93)

61)  Modification to the Temp Block (Subroutine GTCOLD) so that station
     number does not have to be supplied, plus improved error message.
     (9/30/93)

62)  Modified Common block structure (QUALTY.INC) to avoid overlay problems
     that affected land use fractions in the Runoff Block for some
     compilations. (9/30/93)

63)  Addition to Subroutine QHYDRO to allow program to recover from possible
     user error of having more J2 lines than indicated by parameter JLAND for
     Runoff Block land use data. (9/30/93)

64)  Corrected limits on dimensions (from number of watersheds, NW, to number
     of channels, NG) in Runoff Block (DETAIL.INC). (Chuck Moore, CDM,
     9/30/93)

65)  Modified Runoff Block (Subroutine QINT) to calculate initial catchbasin
     load when using multiple land use option (JJ line) by summing
     contribution from each land use fraction (see RUNOFF.DOC). (10/4/93)

66)  Add option to Runoff Block (several subroutines and DETAIL.INC involved)
     to set evaporation to zero during time steps with rain or snowfall (see
     RUNOFF.DOC). (CDM, Chuck Moore, 10/5/93)

67)  Altered error message slightly in Subroutine IERROR, the most common
     message seen by users when there is an input data error. (10/5/93)

68)  Correction in Transport Block for quality routing through storage units,
     and miscellaneous related quality continuity corrections in Subroutines
     QUAL, TSTORG, ROUTE, INITAL, and TRANS.  Without this correction quality
     routing through storage units could generate pollutant mass, causing
     large quality continuity errors. (10/6/93)

69)  A final (??!!) correction to Subroutine QINT for proper buildup
     calculations in Runoff when using multiple land use fractions. (10/8/93)

70)  Modification to Subroutines GTRAIN and RAIN for reading 15-min. rainfall
     according to NOAA-NCDC Release B condensed format (IFORM = 4 or 6).
     (10/12/93)

71)  Correction (Subroutine GUTTER) for metric output of daily-monthly-annual
     quality summaries in the Runoff Block. (Warren Chrusciel, 10/15/93)

72)  Addition of linkage to EPA CEAM WASP (Water Analysis Simulation Program)
     from the Transport Block.  Transport hydraulics are provided to WASP for
     receiving water quality simulations through an interface file generated
     by new Subroutine LINK.  See TRANS.DOC for details.  Involves
     modifications to Subroutines TRANS, INTRAN and HUGO.INC.
     (James L. Martin, AScI Corp., 10/25/93)

73)  Minor improvement to Subroutine TRANSX error message regarding error
     while reading NSCRAT(1). (11/5/93)

74)  Modification to Rain Block labeled Common block structure (PRECIP.INC)
     to avoid boundary problem with array clusters larger than 64 kb.  This
     cures problem of erroneous rainfall values when using user-supplied
     data (IFORM = 3). (11/5/93)

75)  Correction to Subroutine RAIN of Rain Block to avoid dividing by zero
     THISTO during user-supplied rainfall input.  Modification to Subroutine
     G3RAIN to allow hour values for user input to range from 1-24 as well
     as from 0-23 (see RAIN.DOC). (11/12/93)

76)  Runoff Block metric conversion correction for channel/pipe Qfull
     print-out (Subroutine RHYDRO1). (RED, 11/12/93)

77)  Correction to Subroutine HORTON in Runoff Block to help convergence of
     Newton-Raphson iteration (to avoid TP < 0). (11/15/93)

78)  Minor modifications to Subroutine PRPOLL and PRFLOW of Runoff Block for
     minor format changes and to avoid non-zero minima and std. deviation
     for simulation of zero flows. (11/15/93)

79)  Correction for metric rainfall and infiltration depth for individual
     Runoff subcatchment summaries (Subroutine WSTAT). (11/15/93)

80)  Limit number of required initial loads on Runoff Block L1 line to number
     of pollutants, NQS (Subroutine QHYDRO). (11/15/93)

81)  Correction of significant error in Subroutine HEAD of Extran.  The error
     has probably been in the program since version 4.05.  This error had
     caused non-boundary junction surface areas to be half of their true
     value for ordinary subcritical flow calculations.  The principal effect
     was maximum junction areas that were as little as 50% of their correct
     value as listed in the Junction Summary Statistics, most noticeably for
     open channels.  For closed conduits there is a difference, but it is
     variable and not as significant.  Reassuringly, computed flows and
     stages differ by relatively little (typically < 1%) between the
     corrected and former versions. (11/16/93)

82)  Correction to the Combine Block so that the collate and combine options
     can be used with alphanumeric labeling ($ANUM option). (11/23/93)

83)  Miscellaneous minor Combine Block format and output polishing, plus
     option for writing pollutant concentrations instead of loads onto
     readable ASCII interface file (ICOMB=4 option).  See COMB.DOC.
     CAUTION!!  The headers at the beginning of the ASCII interface file have
     been altered.  Persons using spreadsheet macros or other programming to
     read the ASCII interface file will need to revise their programs.
     (11/23/93)

84)  Minor enhancement of read/write error messages from/to the interface
     file (Subroutine INFACE). (11/23/93)

85)  Correct metric output of diameter ("conduit vertical depth") in Extran
     conduit summary (Subroutine OUTPUT).  (Units of cm used but mm
     indicated.  Now use meters.) (11/29/93)

86)  Fix number of Subroutine FIRST arguments in Subroutine TRANS to avoid
     some compiler problems. (RED, 11/29/93)

87)  Correction to Extran Subroutine BOUND to avoid continuity errors in
     outfall link when tide gate is closed. (RED, 11/29/93)

88)  Metric and minor correction to Runoff Sub. RDIIREAD. (RED, 11/29/93)

89)  Add elapsed time printout in seconds to MAIN.FOR. (RED, 11/29/93)

90)  Make summations of flow and quality consistent within the Runoff Block
     and also in the Combine and Statistics Blocks for the case in which
     flows and loads on a Runoff interface file are summed with variable time
     steps.  Formerly there were differences within Runoff and between
     blocks.  Changes to Subroutines HYDRO, QSHED, GUTTER, PRPOLL, PRFLOW,
     WSHED, COMB1, STATS.  Now, should get same total flows and loads in all
     routines.  The integration assumes that when a non-zero flow follows a
     zero flow, the time step for multiplication to get volumes should equal
     the new time step, not the average of the new and the old, because the
     old has the potential to be too long. (11/30/93)

91)  Correct Subroutine RHYDRO1 in Runoff Block to print alphanumeric
     subcatchment names in "Arrangement of Subcatchments and Channel/Pipes."
     (11/30/93)

92)  Modify Subroutine GETCUR for natural channels in Extran and Transport
     so that if a roughness transition occurs exactly at the location of a
     vertical side, the vertical side is assumed to have the lower, main
     channel roughness. (11/30/93)

93)  Correct timing variable in Subroutine LINK for WASP linkage from the
     Transport Block. (J. Martin, 1/3/94)

94)  Fix Subroutine TRANS in Transport Block to read R1 lines properly for
     case of all flow and quality input on a single R1 line. (RED, 1/3/94)

95)  Miscellaneous corrections for array subscript ranges, array references,
     variable initialization, unnecessary metric correction, typos in
     Subroutines FINDA, DEPTH, SMSTAT, ROUTE, RHYDRO1, HEAD and GETCUR.
     (RED, 1/4/94)

96)  Correction to Subroutine HYDRO in Runoff Block to use THISTO as time
     step when THISTO < WET, thus maintaining correct precipitation volume.
     (RED, 1/4/94)

97)  Close NSCRAT(8) in MAIN if necessary, cosmetic changes to Subroutines
     INTRAN, RUNOFF and HYDRO, rearrange Common list in TIMER.INC. (1/4/94)

98)  Correct Subroutine RDIIRES in Runoff Block to fix improper unit
     hydrograph file transfer for rainfall-induced infiltration/inflow
     routine and avoid erroneous flows and large continuity errors. (1/4/94)

99)  Corrections to Runoff Block Subroutines SMSTAT and WSTAT to list proper
     linkages in subcatchment summary and correct time listings in channel/
     pipe summary. (RED, 1/25/94)

100) Correction to Runoff Block Subroutine WSHED to compute air temperature
     at each time step instead of only once per day for ISNOW = 2.
     (RED, 1/31/94)

101) Correction to Transport Block Subroutine OTRAIN to fix metric output of
     Qfull for surcharge summary (formerly in US units). (3/28/94)

102) Modification to Transport Block Subroutines TSTORG, TRANS, OTRAIN and
     TST.INC to permit printing of storage element depth hydrographs for
     storage elements listed on optional I2 line. (Steve Merrill, Brown and
     Caldwell, 3/28/94)

103) Correct Runoff Block Subroutines HYDRO, WSHED, SNOW and GUTTER and
     SUBCAT.INC to ensure that WETDRY time step is used when 1) residual
     overland flow occurs after rainfall stops, 2) snowmelt occurs, 3)
     residual channel/pipe flow occurs after rainfall stops, 4) groundwater
     outflow to channel/pipes occurs.  WET is used only during a time step
     with precipitation.  DRY is used at all other times.  Better resolution
     (and lower continuity errors) during residual flow calculations is thus
     achieved by setting WETDRY closer to WET, but at the expense of added
     computer time during continuous simulations.  Note that WETDRY and DRY
     are only approximated during time intervals without precipitation.
     These intervals are divided into time steps that most closely
     approximate WETDRY and DRY. (4/7/94)

104) Informational message in Runoff Block quality summary (Sub. PRFLOW)
     indicating that buildup is computed only at the beginning of time steps
     with runoff, or for street cleaning time steps. (4/7/94)

105) Initialize two variables in Sub. CATCH in Runoff Block. (4/11/94)

106) Add optional initial date in Extran (Subs. INDAT1, INDAT3 and
     CONTR.INC).  Default is 880101.  Enhances earlier correction #26.
     (4/11/94)

107) Correct logic in Sub. G9RAIN in Rain Block to check correctly for stop
     dates for input of rainfall data. (4/12/94)

108) Enhanced error message in Sub. GTCOLD in Temp Block. (4/18/94)

109) Correct headings for evaporation output in Sub. RHYDRO1 of the Runoff
     Block. (4/19/94)

110) Correct ratio/default option for groundwater input (H2-H4 lines) in
     Runoff Block (Sub. CATCH) and add error message. (4/21/94)

111) Fix headings and array limits for print-out of depths in the Runoff
     Block (Sub. PRFLOW).  Now correctly prints out for more than nine
     locations. (4/22/94)

112) Fix Rain Block (Sub. RAIN) for correct depths in event summary using
     15-min. precipitation and IFORM <= 1. (4/22/94)

113) Modify and correct Rain Block (all Rain Block subroutines plus
     PRECIP.INC) to: 1) permit optional averaging of NCDC accumulated values
     over preceding hours; 2) correct discrepancies between total rain
     printed in Rain vs. Combine Blocks; 3) permit optional print of
     indication of NCDC special codes in Event Summary.  Uses new optional B0
     input line.  Two new subroutines created: RAINAVG and RAINCD.
     (4/25/94 and 4/26/94)

114) Corrected subroutine INTRAN in the Transport Block to accept arbitrary
     sequence of data lines following E1 lines (e.g., following E1 only with
     J2 did not work).  Also minor modification of READ in subroutine LINK.
     (5/10/94)

115) Add error message about duplicate I/O file names to MAIN.  (5/10/94)

116) Include number of barrels in Transport Block continuity check
     (subroutines TRANS and OTRAIN).  (5/12/94)

117) Fix errors in Rain Block (subroutines RAIN, GTRAIN, G9RAIN, RAINAVG) to
     correct errors in implementing #113 above and fix missing first rainfall
     value for IFORM=4.  (5/25/94)

118) Corrected subroutine SMSTAT in Runoff Block to avoid exponentiation
     error in channel/pipe summary table when maximum flow = 0.  (5/25/94)

119) Corrected subroutine WSHED in Runoff Block to avoid zero flows when
     subcatchment has 100% imperviousness with no depression storage
     (PCTZER=100).  (5/25/94)
