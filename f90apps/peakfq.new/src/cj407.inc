C     PKLOG = LOGS, BASE 10 (OUTPUT).   J407 TAKES PROPER ACCOUNT OF
C           NEGATIVE PKS-VALUES -- TREATS THEM AS MISSING VALUES)
C     IPKSEQ = INPUT PEAK SEQUENCE NUMBER (WATER YEAR).
C           (USE MINUS VALUE FOR HISTORIC PEAKS)
C     SYSPP = OUTPUT PLOTTING POSITIONS OF SYSTEMATIC PEAKS.  NOTE-
C           IF THERE ARE HISTORIC PEAKS, THE FIRST NHIST SLOTS OF THIS ARE SET TO
C           NULL VALUES, FOLLOWED BY NSYST VALUES FOR THE SYST PEAKS.
C           THUS THE SYS PROB PLOT POS ARE LINED UP WITH THE
C           SYST PEAKS DISCHARGES, SEQ NOS, QUAL CODES.
C           WRCPP = WRC-ESTIMATED PLOTTING POSITIONS, OUTPUT.
C     XQUAL = INPUT CHARACTER QUALIFICATION CODES.  NOT ACTUALLY USED BY
C           J407 -- THEY ARE ONLY PRINTED.    SEE J407 PRINTOUT FOR SUGGESTED
C           CODES....
